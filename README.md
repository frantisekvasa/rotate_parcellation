# Spherical rotation (permutation) of a parcellated cortical map

Code (in Matlab and R) to perform a spherical rotation (permutation) of a parcellated cortical map. 

For details on this specific implementation of the code, see the Váša et al. *Cerebral Cortex* manuscript referenced below; and in particular the supplementary information section "Spatial permutation test".

## References

This specific implementation of the code was developed specifically for parcellated cortical maps, and was first applied in the following paper:

  * Váša F., Seidlitz J., Romero-Garcia R., Whitaker K. J., Rosenthal G., Vértes P. E., Shinn M., Alexander-Bloch A., Fonagy P., Dolan R. J., Goodyer I. M., the NSPN consortium, Sporns O., Bullmore E. T. (2017). Adolescent tuning of association cortex in human structural brain networks. *Cerebral Cortex*, 28(1):281–294.

However, the idea of a spherical rotation (permutation) was first proposed for vertex-level cortical maps, and first applied (to the best of my knowledge) in the following paper:

  * Alexander-Bloch, A., Raznahan, A., Bullmore, E., and Giedd, J. (2013). The convergence of maturational change and structural covariance in human cortical networks. *Journal of Neuroscience*, 33(7):2889–99.

The same idea was subsequently explored in other papers.

Finally, the idea was more formally discussed in the following paper, where the methods (for vertex-wise analyses) are made publicly available as well:
